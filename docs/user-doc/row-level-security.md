# Row-Level Authorization

**DEPRECATION WARNING**: In older versions of ERMrest, we experimented
with the use of PostgreSQL row-level security. Usage of this feature
of the database is **NOT RECOMMENDED** with current ERMrest
code. Instead, please
use [ERMrest Access Control features](../api-doc/acl/concepts.md).

Previous documentation for using the PostgreSQL feature with ERMrest has
been removed from this documentation page to avoid confusion.
