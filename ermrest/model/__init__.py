A database introspection layer.

At present, the capabilities of this module are limited to introspection of an 
existing database model. This module does not attempt to capture all of the 
details that could be found in an entity-relationship model or in the standard 
information_schema of a relational database. It represents the model as 
needed by other modules of the ermrest project.
